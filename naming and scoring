tess.right(-90)                  #turns tess 90 degrees counter-clockwise, bc of the minus sign
tess.speed(10)                   #sets tess' speed to 10 (faster w/ animation)
tess.left(3600)                  #turns tess 3600 degrees counter-clockwise, again
tess.speed(0)                    #sets tess' speed to 0, fastes possible, turns off animation
tess.left(3645)                  #turns tess 3645 degrees counter-clockwise
tess.forward(-100)               #moves tess backwards 100 "steps"
#no mainloop() makes the screen not close
