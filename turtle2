#4 - Suppose our turtle tess is at heading 0 â€” facing east. We execute the statement tess.left(3645). What does tess do, and what is her final heading?#
#just a note that I gave the turtle the same name as last exercise, for consistency's sake"

import turtle
wn = turtle.Screen()
tugas = turtle.Turtle()
tugas.left(3645)
tugas.forward(100)

wn.mainloop()

#she (yes it's a girl) spins around for a while and then stops at about 45degrees to the upper right#
#the forward method is used just so show where she would be heading#
